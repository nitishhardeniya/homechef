		<h2>We believe in good.</h2>
		<span>
		When we say good, we don’t just mean good food. We also mean the goodness that good food leads to. Good memories, a good temper, a good day, a good burp. And we know that when our food leaves our kitchens, we’re creating all that. It’s rewarding, this belief in good. Now take a look at how we go about it.</span>
